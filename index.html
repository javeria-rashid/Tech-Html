<p>This is my 
<em>first</em> 
html layout practice page after 6<sup>th</sup> 
years</p>
<p> In order to make 
<b>code easier</b>
 to read, web page authors often
add extra spaces or start some
elements on new lines.</p>
<p> When the browser comes across
<strong>two or more spaces</strong> next to each
other,
<br/>
it only displays one space.
<i>Similarly</i> 
if it comes across a line break, it treats that as a single
space too.<br/>
 This is known as
white space collapsing.</p>
